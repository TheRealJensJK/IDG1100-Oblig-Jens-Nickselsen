	<p>To print a message using cronjob every 30 minutes we need to make a new .sh file, to do this we can use the "vi" command to make a file called "script.ssh" We then need to open the file usin "vim script.sh" and can add the folowing code:
	<code>
	#!/bin/bash<br>
	now=$(date)<br>
	echo "Task is scheduald at " $date<br>
	</code>	
	We then save and exit the file. In the terminal we can run the script using cronjob in the folowing manner: "30 * 20 * * script.sh" the script will then run every 30 minutes the rest of the day

	<h3>25. Create a script that takes an input (letter or number) that will display the answer of a question.
	The script should when started list a menu for the user with the different questions that can be
	chosen and which corresponding letter the user will have to give as input to display the answer of
	the desired question. One of the possible inputs the user should be able to make is "q" for quitting
	the script. The menu should also have a default case where all the items is displayed again, or no
	changes is made if the user gives an invalid input. Hint: use a switch case to be able to handle the
	menu. Each option in the menu should lead to an echo of the answer
	</h3>
	<p>To make this game we make a .sh file and add this code:<br>
	<code>
		#!/bin/bash<br>
		q1="What is the capital of Norway?"<br>
		q2="What is the currency in Germany?"<br>
		q3="2 + 2 = ?"<br>
		q4="How many countries are there in the Nordic council?"<br>
		q5="Where does Santa live?"<br>

		echo "Use the numbers on your keyboard to view the awnser for a question " $q1 $q2 $q3 $q4 $q5 " or press q to quit"<br>

		awake=true<br>

		while $awake; do<br>
				read input<br>



		case $input in<br>
				1)<br>
						echo "The capital of Norway is Oslo"<br>
						;;<br>

				2)<br>
						echo "The currency in Germany is the Euro"<br>
						;;<br>

				3)<br>
						echo "2 + 2 = 4"
						;;<br>

				4)<br>
						echo "The Nordic council consists of 5 countries"<br>
						;;<br>

				5)<br>
						echo "Santa lives on the north pole"<br>
						;;<br>

				q)<br>
						awake=false
						;;<br>

				*)<br>
						echo "please enter a valid input"<br>
						;;<br>
				esac<br>
